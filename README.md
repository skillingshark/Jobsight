JobSight: Navigating Future Career Paths through Real-Time Job Market Analysis

Jobsight is a tool that fetches real-time job postings from various sources, analyzes them using the LLM app, and predicts the job market's current status and future trends. It also employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide enhanced insights and predictions.

<!-- ## Technical Implementations

The project fetches real-time job postings from various sources using APIs. It uses the Pathway's LLM App to process and analyze the fetched data. In addition, it employs RAG for enhanced analysis and prediction.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set the API key in the `.env` file.
4. Run the `main.py` file to fetch and process the data: `python main.py`.
5. Run the `app.py` file to start the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
6. Open the Streamlit app in your browser. -->
